Condensed several technologies to optimize gameplay flow. All recipes 
Corrundum planet discovery now available when main planets are available. 
Added a planet connection from nauvis to corrundum. Rip to nice star map.
Petroleum tile can now be covered by landfill
Nerfed space steam production recipe by a factor of about 20,
Adjusted platinum thruster efficiency. It is now efficient only at high fuel consumption. Hence, you want to be cognizant of this thruster when you run low on fuel. 
The goal is not replace normal thrusters, but increase the depth of ship design and allow for faster speeds. Note that this is the inverse of the base thruster, who gets more efficient at low fuel values.
Added achievements related to visiting the Corrundum and using electrochemical science. 
auto_recycle on concrete recipe introduced by this mod is now false. This should ensure that this mod does not alter fulgora recycling. 
Added alternative recrystalization recipes - convert excess gears and cables to their respective sulfate solutions. 
New calcium sulfate recipe. With time consuming effort and techinques from organic chemistry, we can recover calcium sulfate from nutrients. Now we can use calcium sulfate to make lots of stone of gleba. Making use of this recipe is a challenge, and serves as an alternative to importing calcite.
Added fish to icebox functionality and tested it. (Yes fish in the icebox caused a crash because I manually put in stack sizes, and I put in the wrong stack size.)
Fixed the wrong cache being updated upon building/destroying an ice box. 
Added robust nil checking to the code. If we are using tick function on an entity, and we get a nil value, we remake the crash and continue with a different part of the loop.
