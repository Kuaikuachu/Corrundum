corrundum=Corrundum

[space-location-description]
corrundum=A planet blanketed in CO2 gas. Consequently, pressures and temperatures are high here. Runaway greenhouse effect has ensured conditions are harsher than Vulcanus, with no signs of life anywhere between the dirt and the lightning storms. High pressures ensure normally volatile petroleum gas is a liquid here - and there is a ton of it. Iron and copper are mostly locked up together as chalcopyrite. The metal of interest here is platinum, which is used as a catalyst in advanced sulfur processing and as an anode and cathode for electrochemistry. An entirely unique crafting chain centered around sulfur necessary to master this planet.

[item-description]
platinum-ore=A noble metal useful to facilitate catalytic reactions. 
chalcopyrite-ore=A beautiful blue ore that consists of copper and iron bonded to sulfur. FeCuS. 
platinum-plate=Platinum ore that was refined into plates.
asphalt=Refined tar that can made into concrete.
catalytic-chemical-plant=A chemical plant with platinum components. Perfect for catalyzing reactions and electrochemistry.
pressure-laboratory=An unholy lovechild between a lab and chemical plant. This mechanical abomination is crafted under high pressure and can research faster than the normal lab - and with only 50% of the science drain. It is steam powered/pressurized and the high pressures inside the machine allows research to procede faster. However, it rejects science packs of normal quality - normal packs are not suited for the pressures in this machine.
red-boiler=A boiler designed to convert petroleum into hot CO2 gas. As we are trapping most of the gas, this does not produce a lot pollution
red-steam-engine=A modified steam engine. Uses the thermoelectric effect to produce energy. It is designed to take in hot CO2 gas, and produce power - at a significant pollution cost.
ice-box=Plastic box great for keeping spoilables up to 50% fresh!
dry-ice=CO2 cooled into a solid.
sulfur-poison-capsule=A poison capsule that burns sulfur into noxious fumes.

recrystalization=Dissolve excess plates into solution,so they can be recrystalized out of solution into ores
platinum-thruster=Make a thruster that can withstand the heat from consuming incredible amounts of fluid

We then use sulfuric acid to crash calcium sulfate out of solution, and use more water for a recrystalization to purify the calcium sulfate crystals.

automatically-populate-pressure-lab=If true, then data.raw["lab"]["pressure-lab"].inputs EQUALTO data.raw['lab']['lab'].inputs
automatically-populate-labs-with-electrochemical-science=Whether we run through each lab and add electrochemicalscience to its input 
ignore-everything-brute-force-science-into-pressure-lab=At the end of data-updates, we clear out the pressure labs input. Then we add all sciences with the subgroup science pack to the pressure lab. This will break sciences that are only supposed to be used by a single lab, but this action ensures compatibility. Sick of no labs accept all sciences error.
require-vulcanus-before-corrundum=If true, you will have to use metallurgic science to unlock Corrundum
force-reduction-requires-plates=If true, the recipes force-reduction-iron and force-reduction-copper will have iron and copper plates respectively added to their output, and one additional ore returned. Changed the recipe because I felt it was too easy to get legendary items, and I have no way of forcing you to use normal quality. A legendary iron plate will let you get 3 legendary iron ore back from sulfate solution...
consider-planetslib=If true and the mod planetslib is installed, then we don't set lab inputs or add electrochemical science to all labs. Use if you want to let planetslib handle science compatibility
